# Stock Portfolio Optimization

## Overview
In this project, we aim to optimize a portfolio of 100 stocks form various sectors using two different optimization models: Mean-Variance Optimization and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) Optimization. The goal is to construct a portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk.

- **Data Acquisition**: Downloads historical stock data to construct a dataset for analysis using 'yfinance'
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data, including calculating returns and constructing covariance matrices.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Implements optimization techniques (Mean-Variance Optimization and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) Optimization) to derive optimal portfolio weights.
- **Risk Analysis**: Evaluates the portfolio using key risk metrics to compare two optimization models, helping users understand the trade-offs between expected return and risk.
